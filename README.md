## OVERVIEW
Snake Battle is a 2P game where two snakes are trying to kill each other by forcing the head of the other player onto the snake's body. There are two pages, the first page gives an overivew of the game, directions, and a little summary. The second page is the actual game with moving snakes controlled by 2 players.

## RULES
Snakes are controlled by WASD and the arrow keys. There are super-power blocks on the floor that snakes can pick up. There are three types of powerups, speed up, grow big, and clear screen. When snakes move, they leave a trail behind which all snakes will have to avoid. The winner is the last one standing who has not hit any snake or side of the playing field. 

## LANGUAGES
The language used is Javascript. That is what controls the movement of the snakes and the variables that each snake holds within itself. The rest is basic HTML/CSS.
